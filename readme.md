# Rosetta

Rosetta is just a quick localisation tool I coded in C++ in order to quickly set all localisations for my game projects right quickly.
If you have a use for it, by all means, use it. It's licensed under the terms of the GPL3.

# Note

This application is about to be completely rewritten from scratch in C++.
I want to get rid of the .NET framework and thus C# won't help.
